I. To start the current version: click on the index1 file from webstorm and then run firefox from the floating menu... - loads the whole project
To start only the front end: click on the index file from webstorm and then run firefox from the floating menu... - loads the front end only with no data base for adding cocktails

II. The project demonstrates:
1. Front end - HTML, JS, and Bootstrap + more advanced front end
2. Backend - ajax and firebase

III. TODO:
- We could improve on the shown: html and css
- The should be a button from the adding products page (when logged in) returning to the start page (index1.html). Have tried some, but still not working. Still fine for the defense.
- Drago, could add his work on the front end - it will not spoil anything, I guess, but pls careful.
- OK, we can add some statistics, etc... (hardly time for this)
