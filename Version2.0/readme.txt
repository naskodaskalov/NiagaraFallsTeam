I. To start: click on the index file from webstorm and then run firefox from the floating menu...

II. The project demonstrates:
1. Front end - HTML, JS, and Bootstrap
2. Backend - ajax and firebase

III. TODO:
- We could improve on the shown: html and css
- We could add more pages (from the first page, even with no backend functionality)
- OK, we can add some statistics, etc...
